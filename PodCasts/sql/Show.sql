But in conversations we''ve had in the last few weeks, we''ve become more convinced that GDP is a wobbly fact. It''s malleable, and it''s mushy.</p><p style="font-size: 14px; margin: 0px 0px 10px;">GDP can change in a day.

There were international sanctions, and no one in the U.S. or Europe did business there.</p><p style="font-size: 14px; margin: 0px 0px 10px;">But last year, when the international sanctions started to be lifted, companies like Visa and Mastercard were excited to come in.
